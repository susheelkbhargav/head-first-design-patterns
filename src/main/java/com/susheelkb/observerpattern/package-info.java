/**
 * we have two classes and one of these classes changes state 
 * e.g: weather station measuring weather params
 * and we have a subscriber class which want to know if we have a change of 
 * state in the first class
 * 
 * Observer Pattern - Push vs Poll.
 * 
 * One-many relationship and notifies subscribers when state changes
 * 
 * We have observable- (something that is observed )
 * and observer (something that is observing)
 * 
 * observables needs to add , remove notify remove observers
 * 
 * concrete classes
